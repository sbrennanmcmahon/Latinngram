Hello! 
This is the page where I am developing the web app for my Latin ngram viewer. 
It will eventually be an interactive tool that lets you search for any Latin word (or
group of words), and it will produce a graph showing how frequently the word(s) 
appeared over time. I have lemmatized the classical Latin literary canon, and the 
results are normalised to how much text survives from each decade.
For now you are welcome to visit the GitHub repo to access the files:

Best wishes,
Sinead Brennan-McMahon
