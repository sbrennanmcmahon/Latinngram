 <div class="a">Hello! </div> <br>
 <div class="a">This is the page where I am developing the web app for my Latin ngram viewer. It will eventually be an interactive tool that lets you search for any Latin word (or group of words), and it will produce a graph showing how frequently the word(s) appeared over time. I have lemmatized the classical Latin literary canon, and the results are normalised to how much text survives from each decade. I expect to complete the web version by December 2024.</div> <br>
<div class="a">
For now you can view the <a href="https://github.com/sbrennanmcmahon/Latinngram" </a> Github repo</a> for the database and data cleaning files.
